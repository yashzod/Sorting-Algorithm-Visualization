# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization
Step 1. Enter size of array in the box next to "Size of array(10-150)"

        ## The size should be in the range(10,150) inclusive
        ## If the size entered is less than 10, the program sets the value of size=10
        ## If the size entered is more than 150, the program sets the value of size=150

Step 2. Enter speed of vivalization in the box next to "speed(1-100)"

        ## The size should be in the range(1,100) inclusive
        ## If the size entered is less than 1, the program sets the value of size=1
        ## If the size entered is more than 100, the program sets the value of size=100

Step 3. Select the algorithm by clicking on the button with respective name.

        ## If first two steps are skipped, the program will randomly set size of array and the speed of visualization.
